# Model Selection Guide - What We Learned

## Key Discoveries

### 1. **Changing Models is Trivial**
```python
"model": "gpt-4o-mini"  # Just change this string!
```
That's it. No API key changes, no complex setup.

### 2. **Cost Differences are HUGE**
For the same question:
- GPT-4o-mini: $0.00000330
- GPT-4o: $0.00011000
- **GPT-4o is 33x more expensive!**

### 3. **Quality Often Similar for Simple Tasks**
- Simple questions (math, facts): All models work fine
- Complex reasoning: Sometimes GPT-4o is better
- Coding questions: Mixed results

## Practical Model Selection

### Use GPT-4o-mini for:
- Learning/experimentation (basically free)
- Simple queries
- Most agent tasks
- Testing and development
- 95% of use cases

### Use GPT-4o only for:
- Complex reasoning tasks
- When mini fails at something specific
- Production critical decisions
- Tasks requiring nuanced understanding

## Cost Reality Check

With GPT-4o-mini at $0.15 per million tokens:
- 1,000 questions ≈ $0.01 (one penny)
- 10,000 questions ≈ $0.10 (one dime)
- You'd need 100,000+ questions to spend a dollar

## The Model Mystery Solved

**Common Misconceptions:**
❌ "The model is set in my API key" - NO
❌ "I need different API keys for different models" - NO
❌ "Changing models is complicated" - NO

**The Reality:**
✅ Model is just a parameter in your request
✅ Like ordering "small" vs "large" coffee
✅ You can change it per request
✅ Same API key works for all models

## Code Template for Model Selection

```python
# Easy model switching
MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Change this anytime

# Or let user choose
def get_model():
    print("Choose model:")
    print("1. GPT-4o-mini (cheap & fast)")
    print("2. GPT-4o (expensive & smart)")
    choice = input("Choice (1 or 2): ")
    return "gpt-4o-mini" if choice == "1" else "gpt-4o"
```

## Bottom Line

**For learning agents: ALWAYS use gpt-4o-mini**
- It's essentially free
- It's fast enough
- It's smart enough
- Save expensive models for when you actually need them
