LESSON 1: Call AI API and Print Response
==========================================

LEARNING GOAL:
--------------
Understand the fundamental interaction: send text → get text back
No magic, just API calls.

WHAT WE'LL BUILD:
-----------------
A dead-simple program that:
1. Sends a message to an AI (OpenAI or Claude)
2. Gets response back
3. Prints it
That's it. Nothing fancy.

EXERCISES:
----------
Exercise 1: Hardcoded Message
- Send "What is 2+2?" to AI
- Print exactly what comes back
- SEE the actual JSON response structure

Exercise 2: User Input
- Let user type a question
- Send it to AI
- Print response
- Understand the request/response cycle

Exercise 3: Show Everything
- Display what we're sending (the full API request)
- Display what we get back (the full API response)
- See the "man behind the curtain"

Exercise 4: Error Handling
- What happens with no API key?
- What happens with bad API key?
- What happens when API is down?
- Learn to handle failures gracefully

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
-------------------
✓ APIs are just web requests - no mystery
✓ You send JSON, you get JSON back
✓ The AI model is just a parameter you send
✓ System prompts are just another message
✓ API keys are just passwords in headers
✓ Everything is visible and debuggable

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-----------------
By end of Lesson 1, you should be able to:
1. Explain what happens when you call an AI API
2. Debug why an API call failed
3. See exactly what data is being sent/received
4. Feel confident that there's no "magic" happening

KEY INSIGHTS TO REINFORCE:
--------------------------
- The AI has NO memory of previous calls
- Each API call is completely independent
- You're just sending text and getting text back
- Tokens = roughly word count (cost meter)
- The API doesn't know who you are beyond your API key

COMMON CONFUSIONS WE'LL CLEAR UP:
----------------------------------
- "How does the AI remember?" → It doesn't, you resend everything
- "What's a system prompt?" → Just instructions at the start
- "What's a model?" → Which AI brain to use (gpt-4, claude-3, etc)
- "What are tokens?" → How they charge you (like word count)

INTENTIONALLY SKIPPING:
-----------------------
- Conversation history (Lesson 2)
- Tools/Functions (Lesson 3)  
- Complex prompts (Later)
- UI/Web interface (Much later)
- Deployment (Not relevant yet)

REMEMBER:
---------
This lesson is ONLY about understanding the basic API call.
If we find ourselves doing ANYTHING else, we've gone off track.
