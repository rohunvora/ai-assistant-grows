# AI Agent Learning Progress Tracker

## Current Status: LESSON 1 - Basic API Calls
**Started**: Just now
**Goal**: Understand that AI APIs are just text in → text out

---

## Learning Path

### ✅ Pre-Work Completed
- [x] Understood why agents fail (loops, no memory)
- [x] Identified personal pain points (API confusion, .env files)
- [x] Created learning environment

### 🔄 LESSON 1: Call AI API & Print Response
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Focus**: Just make an API call work and see what happens
**Key Learning**: APIs aren't magic, just web requests

### ⏳ LESSON 2: Add Memory (Conversation History)
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Focus**: Make AI "remember" previous messages
**Key Learning**: YOU manage memory, not the AI

### ⏳ LESSON 3: Add One Tool
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Focus**: Let AI "do" something (calculator)
**Key Learning**: AI suggests tools, YOUR code runs them

### ⏳ LESSON 4: Add Loop Detection
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Focus**: Prevent infinite loops
**Key Learning**: Track what's been tried

### ⏳ LESSON 5: Add Multiple Tools
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Focus**: Tool selection and orchestration
**Key Learning**: AI as decision maker

### ⏳ LESSON 6: Add State Management
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Focus**: Track world state beyond conversation
**Key Learning**: Agents need external memory

### ⏳ LESSON 7: UI (Optional)
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Focus**: Web interface if desired
**Key Learning**: UI is separate from agent logic

## Rules for This Learning Journey

1. **One lesson at a time** - Don't jump ahead
2. **Understanding > Coding** - Know WHY before HOW
3. **See everything** - No hidden magic
4. **Break when confused** - Stop and clarify immediately
5. **Celebrate small wins** - Each API call that works is progress
